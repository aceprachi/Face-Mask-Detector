# Face Mask Detector

## Project Overview
The **Face Mask Detector** is a real-time computer vision project that identifies whether a person is wearing a face mask using deep learning and video processing techniques. By leveraging transfer learning on a pre-trained model, this system can classify faces as either "mask" or "no mask" with high accuracy.

### Key Features
- **Real-time mask detection** via webcam input
- **TensorFlow object detection API** for enhanced performance
- **SSD MobileNetV2 320x320** pre-trained model for transfer learning
- **97.07% accuracy** on real-time video streams
- Provides visual feedback using bounding boxes and text

### Technical Highlights
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow and OpenCV for deep learning and image processing
- **Optimizer and Loss:** Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function
- **Dataset:** Trained on 1,878 images
- **Face Detection:** Uses Haar Cascade Classifier for initial face localization
- **Interface:** User-friendly, real-time mask detection feedback

## Prerequisites

### Required Skills and Knowledge:
- **Python Programming:** Understanding of Python syntax, file operations, and debugging.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Experience with CNNs, transfer learning, and model evaluation metrics.
